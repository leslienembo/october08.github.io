        <h1>Answers Only God Can Give</h1>
        <p>Ben Hering is a Wisconsin-born, Minneapolis-based artist whose concepts utilize ancestral photos, religious iconography, and mythological motifs as vehicles to examine identity. Through found materials, multi-media layering, sawing, and sanding, Ben's latest work brings playfulness to heavy conversations. By marrying bright palettes with dilapidated wood, the warmth of nostalgia with the precariousness of rust, he explores the relationship between the natural, the spiritual, and the human experience.</p>
        
        <p>Tchana Pierre is a Cameroon-born, Boston-based artist whose work delves into the physical and psychological effects of human emotions on the mind and body. Through his art, Pierre explores how feelings such as love, joy, anxiety, grief, and lust manifest within us, shaping our perceptions, behaviors, and physical forms. Working primarily in acrylic and film, Pierre combines figuration and abstraction to challenge the viewer's understanding of the real and pseudo-real.</p>
        
        <p>The two artists’ journeys collided during the pandemic, finding connection and commonality in their expressions. There’s an immediacy and intimacy in the organic forms, the raw textures, and familiar patterns providing the comforts of a universal home. The viewer is assured by the intentions and imperfections—the unfolding nature of the work is something you’ve felt before.</p>
        
        <p>Bringing together individually produced pieces that have yet to interact, this is an experiment in our innate interconnectedness—we seek to define and, simultaneously, bridge the gap between our individuality and our collective spirit. What happens when we meet? These are <em>Answers Only God Can Give.</em></p>
